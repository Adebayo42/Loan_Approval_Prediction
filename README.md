# Loan Approval Prediction: Machine Learning Pipeline

🔍 **Overview**

Loan approval is crucial for financial institutions, impacting profitability and risk. Traditional manual evaluations are slow and prone to bias. This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to improve loan approval predictions, leveraging **ensemble models** and **advanced preprocessing** for high accuracy and fairness.

📌 **Key Features:**

✅ **Multi-Model Approach:** Uses **Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Stacking Classifier, and Soft Voting Classifier**  
✅ **Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline:** Handles missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and oversampling (SMOTE)  
✅ **Optimized Performance:** Balances bias-variance tradeoff with **Bayesian Optimization** and **Ensemble Learning**  
✅ **Scalability:** Can be extended to real-time loan approval systems in banking and fintech  




🔧 **Technology Stack**  
Python 🐍 | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | LightGBM | CatBoost | Imbalanced-learn | Pandas | NumPy | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Bayesian Optimization | Category Encoders

🛠 **How It Works**

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables (`category_encoders`)
   - Feature scaling with `MinMaxScaler`
   - Apply **SMOTE** for imbalanced data

2️⃣ **Model Training, Stacking & Soft Voting:**
   - Train individual models (**Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost**)
   - Combine them into a **Stacked Ensemble Model** and **Soft Voting Classifier** for improved predictions

3️⃣ **Evaluation & Performance Metrics:**
   - Compute **ROC-AUC Scores**
   - Compare stacked model vs. individual classifiers

🏆 **Why This Project Stands Out**

🔹 Demonstrates real-world **data science skills**: feature engineering, imbalanced data handling, model optimization  
🔹 **Employs advanced ensemble learning techniques** for better predictions than traditional ML models  
🔹 **Scalable & adaptable** to real-world banking applications  

🚀 **Installation & Requirements**
